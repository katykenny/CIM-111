      and lacrosse teams- and a beautiful soul. Alex is a loyal friend to so many, an amazing daughter

        <h3>HER FIGHT</h3>
        <p>On April 25, after discovering a mass on her shoulder that seemed to be growing rapidly,
          Alex was diagnosed with metastatic Ewing's Sarcoma. The cancer has metastasized to her
          lungs and Alex has been in aggressive chemotherapy and radiation for the past few months.
          She has been admitted into Columbia Presbyterian for her treatments. </p>

      need to focus all of their energy on helping her through these treatments.  We would like to
      relieve them of as much financial burden as possible, so they can fight beside Alex as
      much as possible.  Travel expenses alone have added up quickly, as Alex has spent
      at least 8 days of every month in the hospital. Financial aid can be contributed via
