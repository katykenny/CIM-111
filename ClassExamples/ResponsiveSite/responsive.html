        <h1 class="small-title">Her Fight</h1>
        <p>On April 25, after discovering a mass on her shoulder that seemed to be growing rapidly,
          Alex was diagnosed with metastatic Ewing's Sarcoma.  The cancer has metastasized to her
          lungs and Alex has been in aggressive chemotherapy and radiation for the past few months.
          She has been admitted into Columbia Presbyterian for her treatments as to ensure
          the proper medical supervision throughout. </p>

    <h1 class="small-title">Donate</h1>
    <p>We are asking for your help because, as you can imagine, Alex's parents, Jennifer and Rick,
      need to focus all of their energy on helping Alex through these treatments.  We would like to
      relieve them of as much financial burden as possible, as to avail them to fight beside Alex as
      much as they are able.  Travel expenses alone will begin to add up quickly, as Alex has spent
      at least 8 days of every month in the hospital. </p>
