<div id="about-me">
  <p>Hello! My name is Katy Kenny and I'm currently a college student studying at the University of Miami's Frost School of Music.
    <br>I thrive doing anything involving creativity. Whether it's finding unconventional ways to portray emotion through the arts,
    or coming up with inventive marketing tactics, I love thinking "outside the box". <br> I find it easy implimenting this mentality
    into just about any workplace or environment.</p>
