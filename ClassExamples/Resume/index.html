    <p>Hello! My name is Katy Kenny and I'm currently a college student studying at the University of Miami's Frost School of Music.
      <br>I thrive doing anything involving creativity. Whether it's finding unconventional ways to portray emotion through the arts,
      or coming up with inventive marketing tactics, I love thinking "outside the box". <br> I find it easy implimenting this mentality
      into just about any workplace or environment.</p>
